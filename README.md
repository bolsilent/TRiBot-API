This project was used to generate and walk paths within Oldschool Runescape using Tribot. This is just sample code and will not compile. Not all classes required to use this code are included.

Pathwalker.class - Methods within this class are used to walk to objects, npcs, tiles, etc. Normally first point of entry for any script that would need to walk.

DPath.class - Methods within this class are used to generate a valid path given the collision data within the loaded chunks. Static objects and openable doors are taken into account when generating these paths.
